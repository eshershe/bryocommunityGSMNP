# bryocommunityGSMNP

Within this set of files are raw and computed data for the various analyses of this project. 
Files contain presence/absence data for bryophytes measured in centimeters at each plot across 30 meters of transect line, count data for the tree species present/absent at each site,
gap fraction (a measure of canopy openness) calculated via ImageJ hemispherical 2.0 for the two time points, total bryophyte cover at each plot at the two time points, and totel alpha 
diversity at each plot at the two time points.

Diversity data was also calculated across Hill numbers for GLMs. Slope, aspect, elevation were obtained from ArcGIS and change in gap fraction, alpha diversity, and percent cover were calculated 
from the data collected in 2007/08 and 2020/21.
